# Roman-Numeral-Converter
This code changes roman numerals to numbers, and vice versa.
It uses two lengthy if/else if statements. 
-For the numerals to number conversion it parses each numeral and converts it to a number, then subtracts from the total if the numeral is smaller than the one in front of it, or adds to the total if the numeral is larger than the one in front of it.
-For the number to numeral conversion it subtracts from the number the largest possible value corresponding to a roman numeral, and concatenates that numeral to a string. 

Future edits include beautiful css to make the UI cleaner, as well as input validation.
